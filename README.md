## How to Use

</div>

Whenever somebody chats in the channel specified in [`config.json`](/config.json#L2), the channel will be locked until there is no activity spotted for the amount of time specified in [`config.json`](/config.json#L3) (I've currently set it to five minutes, but you can change it if needed).

<br>

The channel will be unlocked until the next person chats in it, and the cycle repeats. You can also see the status of the channel from the channel _name_ at any given time. If it is unlocked, it will show a ðŸ”“. Otherwise, it will show ðŸ”’.

<br>

**Note:** Make sure the default permissions for the specified channel are as shown:

1. @everyone
   - `READ_MESSAGES`: true
   - `SEND_MESSAGES`: true
2. Bot user or role
   - `READ_MESSAGES`: true
